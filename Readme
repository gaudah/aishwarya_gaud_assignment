//We have to send cid,pid instead of message using producer and that cid,pid get consumed by /bookCustProd api to book the product

node Producer.js
node Consumer.js
node ../server.js

Run:
http://localhost:3001/sendPayload
http://localhost:3002/consumePayload
http://localhost:3002/handleRequest
http://localhost:3002/getAllRequests

Here we used the kafka to avoid dropping the booking requests because kafka maintains the queue (FIFO) to manage the requests prescribed and subscribed.
